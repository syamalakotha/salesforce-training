Response Generation
↓
Action Execution

---

## Step 1: User Asks Question

The process begins when a user interacts with the AI agent.

### Example

Student asks:

"What is my attendance percentage?"

The question is sent to the AI agent.

---

## Step 2: AI Agent

The AI agent interprets the request.

### Responsibilities

* Understand user intent
* Identify required information
* Determine required actions

### Example

AI identifies that attendance data is needed.

---

## Step 3: Flow / Apex

The AI agent invokes Salesforce automation.

### Responsibilities

* Execute business logic
* Apply validations
* Retrieve information

### Example

A Flow or Apex class retrieves attendance records.

---

## Step 4: Database

Salesforce database stores all relevant records.

### Data Retrieved

* Student information
* Attendance records
* Course details

### Example

Attendance percentage is calculated using stored records.

---

## Step 5: Response Generation

The AI agent converts retrieved data into a human-readable response.

### Example

"Your current attendance percentage is 82%."

The response is generated dynamically.

---

## Step 6: Action Execution

The AI agent may perform additional actions.

### Examples

* Send notification
* Create task
* Update record
* Trigger approval process

### Example

If attendance falls below 75%, the AI may automatically send a warning notification.

# Risks of Enterprise AI

Although AI provides many benefits, organizations must manage risks carefully.

---

## Risk 1: Incorrect Responses

### Problem

AI may generate inaccurate information.

### Impact

Wrong decisions may be made.

### Example

Incorrect attendance information provided to students.

---

## Risk 2: Data Privacy Concerns

### Problem

Sensitive data may be exposed.

### Impact

Security and compliance violations.

### Example

Unauthorized access to student records.

---

## Risk 3: Bias in Recommendations

### Problem

AI recommendations may not always be fair.

### Impact

Unfair outcomes.

### Example

Incorrect placement recommendations.

---

## Risk 4: Over-Automation

### Problem

Too many decisions delegated to AI.

### Impact

Reduced human oversight.

### Example

Automatic approvals without review.

---

## Risk 5: Security Threats

### Problem

AI systems may become targets for misuse.

### Impact

Unauthorized actions or data access.

### Example

Malicious requests attempting to retrieve confidential information.

---

# Best Practices for Enterprise AI

### Human Oversight

Critical decisions should be reviewed by humans.

### Data Security

# Enterprise AI Reflection

Enterprise AI should assist people rather than replace governance and business controls. AI agents can improve productivity, automate repetitive tasks, and provide faster responses. However, organizations must ensure data security, accuracy, compliance, and human oversight. Properly implemented AI systems can significantly enhance student support, faculty operations, placements, recruitment, and overall institutional efficiency.

# Reflection

This exercise helped me understand how Salesforce Agentforce and AI agents can automate business processes and improve user experiences. I learned various AI use cases in college management, recruitment, placements, student support, and faculty operations. The AI workflow demonstrated how user requests travel through AI agents, Flows, Apex, databases, and action execution. I also learned about the risks of enterprise AI, including inaccurate responses, privacy concerns, bias, and security challenges. Overall, this activity strengthened my understanding of AI-powered automation and responsible AI usage in enterprise systems.
