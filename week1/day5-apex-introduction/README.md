# Salesforce Apex and Enterprise System Design

# 1. What is Apex?

Apex is a strongly typed, object-oriented programming language developed by Salesforce. It is used to add custom business logic to Salesforce applications.

Apex allows developers to:
- Create custom functionality
- Automate business processes
- Write triggers and classes
- Integrate Salesforce with external systems
- Perform database operations using SOQL and DML

Apex syntax is similar to Java and runs on the Salesforce Platform.

# 2. Difference Between Flow vs Apex

| Flow | Apex |
|------|------|
| Low-code automation tool | Full programming language |
| Easy for admins | Used mainly by developers |
| Drag-and-drop interface | Written using code |
| Best for simple automation | Best for complex logic |
| Faster to build | More flexible and powerful |
| Limited customization | Unlimited customization |

---

# Difference Between Configuration vs Coding

| Configuration | Coding |
|--------------|--------|
| No-code or low-code customization | Full custom development |
| Uses clicks instead of code | Uses Apex, LWC, APIs |
| Easier and faster | More advanced |
| Used by admins | Used by developers |
| Best for standard business needs | Best for complex requirements |

# 3. Real Examples Where Apex Is Needed

## Example 1: Automatic Email Notification

When a student fee payment fails multiple times, Apex can automatically send warning emails to the student and admin.

---

## Example 2: Integration with External Payment Gateway

Apex is used to connect Salesforce with online payment systems like Razorpay or PayPal.

---

## Example 3: Complex Admission Logic

If course seats are full:
- Add student to waiting list
- Calculate eligibility
- Assign priority based on marks

This complex logic is best handled using Apex.

# 4. Integrated College Management System Design

# CRM Overview

The College Management System is built on Salesforce CRM to manage:
- Student admissions
- Courses
- Faculty
- Fee payments
- Academic records

The system centralizes all college data into one platform.

---

# Objects Used

| Object Name | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| Student__c | Stores student information |
| Course__c | Stores course details |
| Faculty__c | Stores faculty information |
| Admission__c | Stores admission records |
| Fee_Payment__c | Stores payment details |

---

# Relationships

| Parent Object | Child Object | Relationship |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Course__c | Student__c | One-to-Many |
| Student__c | Admission__c | One-to-Many |
| Student__c | Fee_Payment__c | One-to-Many |
| Faculty__c | Course__c | One-to-Many |

---

# Validation Rules Used

## Student Age Validation

```text
Age__c < 17
```

### Purpose
Prevents underage students from applying.

---

## Course Seat Validation

```text
Filled_Seats__c > Total_Seats__c
```

### Purpose
Prevents admissions when seats are full.

---

## Email Validation

```text
ISBLANK(Email__c)
```

### Purpose
Ensures student email is mandatory.

---

# Flows Used

| Flow Name | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Admission Flow | Automates student admission |
| Fee Reminder Flow | Sends payment reminders |
| Course Allocation Flow | Assigns courses automatically |
| Welcome Email Flow | Sends confirmation emails |
| Record Update Flow | Updates student status |

---

# Apex Usage in System

| Apex Component | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| Apex Trigger | Update student status automatically |
| Apex Class | Calculate student eligibility |
| Queueable Apex | Process bulk student records |
| API Integration | Connect payment gateway |

# 5. Pseudocode Examples

# Example 1: Admission Eligibility

```text
IF student percentage >= 75
    Approve Admission
ELSE
    Reject Admission
END
```

---

# Example 2: Seat Availability

```text
IF remaining seats > 0
    Allow Admission
ELSE
    Show "Course Full"
END
```

---

# Example 3: Fee Payment Status

```text
IF payment completed
    Update Status = Paid
ELSE
    Send Reminder
END
```

---

# Example 4: Student Attendance Alert

```text
IF attendance < 75%
    Send Warning Email
END
```

# 6. Reflection: Why Enterprise Systems Eventually Need Programming

Enterprise systems start with simple business processes that can often be handled using configuration and automation tools. However, as organizations grow, business requirements become more complex.

Large systems eventually require programming because:
- Complex business logic cannot always be handled using clicks
- External system integrations require APIs and custom code
- Large-scale data processing needs optimized logic
- Security and custom workflows need advanced control
- Automation becomes more dynamic and intelligent

Programming languages like Apex help organizations build scalable, secure, and customized enterprise applications that meet real-world business needs efficiently.

A combination of configuration and coding provides the best enterprise solution because it balances speed, flexibility, automation, and scalability.
